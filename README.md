# climate_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

- A Flutter app that creates a simple user interface with a text input field. Users can enter the name of a city, and the app will display a card with weather information for that city.
- The weatehrcard.dart handles searching weather information based on a given city. It makes requests to the OpenWeatherMap API to obtain geographic and meteorological information such as city name, temperature, weather description, etc.
